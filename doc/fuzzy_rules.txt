outside temperature:
   - in order to determine how much heat will be lost while heating the room
     thus knowing how much time should the heat be left on to achieve the exact
     desidered temperature
humidity:
   - not sure yet 
inside temperature:
   - the temperature indoors
target temperature:
   - the remperature that needs to be reached
     the higher the temperature the more should the heat be left on
room light level:
   - the higher the light level, the greater the felt temperature is
rate of heating
   - the faster the room heats up, the sooner we can turn of the heating,
     thus saving energy
rate of cooling
   - the faster the cooling, the sooner we can start the heating so the
     temperature would be constant?

Control data like rapid cool down or rapid heat up?

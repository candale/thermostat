\begin{abstract}

This paper presents an accessible approach to an efficient, intelligent, Internet of Things $(IoT)$ enabled
thermostat to be used, instead of the usual, naive thermostats that are currently in a reasonable price range
on the market. The current means by which most of the population control their house temperature is to use a
simple, straight-forward thermostat that is simply reactive to only the temperature it records and the
temperature set point of the user. The anticipated outcome of the proposed approach is to create a new kind of
thermostat that is first of all affordable, making the most of the new technologies we have, accessible through
the infrastructure which the Internet provides and intelligent, giving the user an improved experience and
greater energy management control.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}

\qquad The evolution of modern technologies has lead to an increased number of Do-It-Yourself $(DIY)$ possibilities in
the field of electronics and microchips; thus it has become easy and affordable to incorporate such
technologies in mundane, house-hold objects that can present themselves with some data that may be relevant.
This new concept turned into a movement now called the Internet of Things $(IoT)$.

We use the term “Internet of Things” to refer to the general idea of things, especially everyday objects, that
are readable, recognizable, locatable, addressable, and/or controllable via the Internet,
wireless LAN, wide-area network, or other means. Everyday objects include not only the electronic devices we
encounter everyday, and not only the products of higher technological development such as vehicles and
equipment, but things that we do not ordinarily think of as electronic at all, such as food, clothing, and
shelter; materials, arts, and sub-assemblies; commodities and luxury items; landmarks, boundaries,
and monuments; and all the miscellany of commerce and culture \cite{DisruptiveCivilTechnologies}
\cite{DisruptiveCivilTechnologiesAppendix}.

In order for this concept to grow, technologies had to be made available to the general public, meaning that
the cost at which they came had to be affordable. Fortunately, the current technological context lead to
the development of cheap and powerful components which can now be used to build the infrastructure of the IoT.

With the now given possibility to acquire powerful, yet cheap, means by which one can control and gather data
from different contexts, various applications can be developed, like the one described in this paper.
The chosen hardware for the proposed thermostat consists of three microcontrollers, temperature and humidity sensors
and a radio transceiver, all coming to a price comparable to a normal thermostat. The main processing unit
is an ESP8266 wireless module.

Fuzzy logic was first proposed by Lotfi Zadef in his paper \say{Fuzzy Sets} \cite{FuzzySets}. At first, the
idea received a lot of criticism from the mathematical community and the world was skeptic in implementing it
on real devices, but Japan took the lead and the first real-life applications that used fuzzy logic appeared on
the market in the late 1980's \cite{zadeh1996fuzzy}. The most memorable such application was the Sendai subway
system designed by Hitachi where fuzzy logic was used to control the train's acceleration, deceleration and
breaking \cite{zadeh1996fuzzy}. Since its production it is said that it not only reduces the energy
consumption by 10\%but the passengers hardly notice when the train is changing its velocity
\cite{FuzzyLogicMassUse}. Since then, fuzzy logic has been used in devices ranging from shower heads
\cite{zadeh1996fuzzy} to gear boxes and car breaking systems \cite{FuzzyAutomotive}.

In the field of temperature control, fuzzy logic was applied with success in AC's \cite{FuzzyAppliences} where
an energy saving of at least 3.5\% was observed. It has been shown that by this approach at temperature
control, given a small number of rules and not needing advanced knowledge about the environment (e.g. a
mathematical model of the problem is not required) a fuzzy logic controller is able to achieve faster transient
response with less overshoot, more stable steady state response and less dependence of operating point
\cite{FuzzyTempControl}.

This paper presents an approach to a fuzzy logic thermostat that aims to increase the energy efficiency
of temperature control, where a standard, ON/OFF, central heating unit is used. An important aspect of this
proposal is the hardware implementation which is designed to reduce the cost of such an application and to
enable it to be accessed through the infrastructure of the Internet.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the motivation to build such a thermostat, Section III
consists of information needed to understand the sections that follow, Section IV explains the proposed
approach, Section V outlines the hardware architecture and human interaction and Section VI presents the conclusion
that were drawn.

\section{Motivation}
\label{Motivation}

The motivation behind this proposal is three-fold: affordability, efficiency and connectivity.

The time we are living in presents itself with rapidly occurring technological breakthroughs that help
humankind in setting up for themselves a better, more comfortable and efficient world. The greater problem concerning
this is that it does not come cheap. Advanced electronics were not affordable to the general public so the vast
majority of people were unable to get access to them, let alone develop \say{things} having them as a platform. This
situation has changed in the past few years and now we have easy access to such devices enabling the
contribution of everybody to the Internet of Things.

Having access to diverse pieces of technology lets anybody create mechanisms through which data is gathered
from the environment, analyzed and used to make existing processes more efficient. The Internet of Things
offers the means by which one may find patterns that are otherwise invisible, thus leading to a greater
understanding of the context we are living in, which in turn lets us control that context in a more efficient
manner.

All these connected devices means that data can be shared and used in a collaborative manner and the
possibility to control processes from afar arises. For the application in discussion, this fact enables one to
monitor and control one's house temperature setting from anywhere thus increasing the comfort level. For
example, going away from home, one would turn the temperature down but when coming back, it is desirable to
have the house already at a comfortable temperature level. This can be achieved by being connected to your
home thermostat.

\section{Related Work}
\label{Related Work}

There are a lot of implementation of intelligent thermostats, but the one that stood out is Nest Thermostat
created by Google \cite{website:nest}. Nest is a IoT enabled thermostat that learns the behavior of the
occupants of the environment it lies in and controls the temperature accordingly. For example, in a week's
time, it can learn that at 9 AM every work day, the occupants leave the house and come back at 5 PM. After
learning this, the thermostat can keep the temperature down as long as nobody home and heat it up half an
hour before the occupants get home. This can save energy up to 24\$ \cite{website:nestsaving}.
The thermostat is accessible through the clod and it also generates statistics and suggestions based on
one's specific energy consume signature. The details of the learning algorithms are not yet disclosed.

Another fuzzy logic thermostat approach is presented in article \cite{FuzzyAppliences}. The fuzzy engine
that thermostat uses takes in five input parameters with are worth mentioning: number of set-temperature
changes, temperature error (difference between the set and room temperatures), last set-temperature change,
number of room temperature changes and brightness in the room. The las input is a rather interesting one
because, indeed, the level of sunlight that enters a room, affects the perceived temperature
\cite{human_comfort}. The approach presented in this article increases energy efficiency by 3.5\% compared
to a normal thermostat.

With the apparition of Nest thermostat from Google, the DIY community reacted and created a thermostat that
has some of the feature presented by Google on their device, while being open source \cite{website:nestos}. It
runs in the cloud, has a basic physical user interface and it price comes to half of that of the Nest
thermostat. This initiative showed that with currently available technologies, one can design and implement
such a device at a reasonable price with.

\section{Theoretical Background}
\label{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Fuzzy logic}

As stated before, the proposed thermostat is using fuzzy logic for the decision engine because to model the
problem using mathematics would be much to complex for a simple microcontroller to handle and specific data
about each environment would have to be known.

Fuzzy logic is an extension of Boolean logic coined by Lotfi Zadef. Fuzzy logic is built on the theory of
fuzzy sets which is a generalization of the classical set theory. He introduced the notion of degree in the
verification of a condition such that it could be in a state different from true or false. This provides a
valuable extended flexibility for reasoning that makes it possible to take into account inaccurate data.
One advantage of fuzzy logic is that the rules by which the reasoning is made can be expressed in natural
language making it easy to take advantage of a human expert and the knowledge he/she posses.

Next, the concepts surrounding fuzzy logic will be explained.
\subsubsection{Fuzzy sets}

A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership\cite{FuzzySets}.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:fuzzye_set}
Let $X$ be a set. A $fuzzy$ subset $A$ of $X$ is characterized by a \textbf{membership function}
\begin{align}
f^{a}: X \rightarrow [0, 1]
\end{align}
Note: This membership function is equivalent to the identity function of a classical set. Figure
\ref{fig:mf_comparison} presents a graphical difference between the two.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\label{fig:mf_comparison}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=identity.eps,width=0.4\textwidth}}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=membership_mf.eps,width=0.4\textwidth}}
      \caption[MainModule]{Comparison between a identity function of a conventional set and a membership
                           function of fuzzy set.}
\label{fig:mf_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Linguistic variables and values}
\begin{definition}
\label{def:ling_var}
Let $V$ be a variable (temperature, humidity etc), $X$ the range of values of the variable and $T_{V}$ a
finite or infinite set of fuzzy sets. A \textbf{linguistic variable} corresponds to the triplet (V, X, $T_{V}$).
\end{definition}

By a linguistic variable we mean a variable whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial
language. For example, age is a linguistic variable if its values are linguistic rather than numerical, i.e.,
young, not young, very young, quite young, old, not very old not very young, etc., rather than 20, 21, 22,
23 \cite{ling_vars_zadeh}.

The concept of membership function discussed above allows us to define fuzzy systems in a natural language,
thus we can label different ranges of values for an input. For example, having a linguistic variable
called \say{music} we have the linguistic value \say{silent}, \say{moderate} and \say{loud}. The membership
functions for these values may describe a trapezium, a triangle, or anything else depending on the problem in
question.

\subsubsection{Fuzzy operators}

In order to properly manipulate fuzzy sets, the operators from classical set theory are redefined to fit the
membership function values that are in rage $[0, 1]$. These operators can be chosen, having to kinds: Zadeh
or probabilistic operators.
Zadeh operators are in the following form:
\begin{align}
AND = min($\mu$_{A}(x), $\mu$_{B}(x))
\end{align}
\begin{align}
OR = max($\mu$_{A}(x), $\mu$_{B}(x))
\end{align}
\begin{align}
NOT = 1 - $\mu$_{A}(x)
\end{align}

while probabilistic operators:
\begin{align}
AND = $\mu$_{A}(x) \times $\mu$_{B}(x)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
OR = $\mu$_{A}(x) + $\mu$_{B}(x) - $\mu$_{A}(x) \times $\mu$_{B}(x)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
NOT = 1 - $\mu$_{A}(x)
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Fuzzy logic reasoning}

In fuzzy logic, reasoning is based on \textbf{fuzzy rules} that are expressed in natural language using the
above described linguistic variables. A fuzzy rule has the form:
\begin{align}
if x \in A \quad and \quad y \in B \quad or \quad z \in C \quad then \quad d \in U
\end{align}

For example: \par
\say{if food is good and treatment is nice then tip is great}.

After computing the degree of membership of the linguistic variables \say{food} and \say{treatment} to their
respective linguistic values from the antecedent, \say{good} and \say{nice}, the binary fuzzy logic operator \say{and}
will be applied which will get the minimum of the two degrees.
The variable \say{tip} belongs to the linguistic value \say{great} to the degree of validity of the
premise.

The next step in arriving at a result is to determine the fuzzy implication of the antecedent. There are
several fuzzy implication patterns out there but the most commonly known are Mamdani fuzzy implication and
Larsen fuzzy implication.
Mamdani fuzzy implication takes the minimum between the resulting antecedent membership function and the
consequent membership function
\begin{align}
Mamdani \quad min(f_{a}, f_{b})
\end{align}
while Larse fuzzy implication model takes the product of the two
\begin{align}
Larsen \quad f_{a} \times f_{b}
\end{align}

The result will be the membership function of the consequent or a clipped version of it. \par

The case can present itself when we have multiple rules for which the consequent is identical. \par
For example: \par
\say{if food is bad and treatment is bad then tip is low}\par
and \par
\say{if temperature is good and treatment is bad then tip is low} \par
In such a case, the value that is chosen is the one for which the resulting membership function is the
greatest. For example if the resulting membership function for the first rule is 0.45 and the resulting
membership function for the second rule is 0.7, for the linguistic value \say{off} of variable
heating\_status will be 0.7.

After having the membership functions of all the consequents, a final result can be achieved by defuzzifying
them. This is done by finding the abscissa of the center of gravity corresponding to the polygon described in the
membership functions of all the output linguistic variables. Figure \ref{fig:fuzzy_to_end} shows a graphical
example of what the result of the rules represent and how they form a polygon whose center of gravity
represents the actual result.

\subsection{Internet of Things}

The term \say{Internet of Things} has first been mentioned by Kevin Ashton in 1999 at a MIT presentation, when
he stated that adding a RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to everyday objects would create an Internet
of Things. The main idea behind the IoT, as expressed by Ashton \cite{IoTThing}, is that ever since the
computers were invented, the main source of data that is on the Internet and in all of computers it mainly
human in nature. This mean that the massive amount of information that Internet provides is mainly created
by people \say{by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code}
\cite{IoTThing}. The problem with this is that human beings are limited in what they can observe, how much
data they can produce and in the accuracy with which they can analyze.

With the advent of technologies like sensors, we can now equip computers to collect data from the environment
with a much larger precision, from nearly all sorts of contexts that people were unable to reach and most
importantly, in a continuous fashion. As Kevin Ashton famously put it: \say{We need to empower computers with
their own means of gathering information, so they can see, hear and smell the world for themselves, in all its
random glory} \cite{IoTThing}.

The Internet of Things represents all of the devices, objects or other \say{things} that sense the environment
they are in, collect data about that environment and share this information over a network, usually the
Internet, thus the term IoT. This collaborative approach to gathering data presents itself with a few
challenges, as presented in the CERP-IOT report \cite{CERPIOT}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Scale: With an increasing number of objects that are integrate into the IoT (millions if not
    billions) monitoring and receiving data from all of them becomes a massive task in terms of memory,
    computational power and energy consumption.

    \item Large heterogeneity: With the rise of the IoT, more and more \say{things} were integrated
    with the Internet and the rate at which this develops grows only faster. This has lead to a large number
    of different devices that operate on various operating system, software platforms and hardware
    implementations which makes it harder to interact with them in standard way.

    \item Incomplete or inaccurate information about the \say{things}: Having an ever increasing number of
    devices in the IoT infrastructure, wanting to access anyone of them requires some knowledge about the
    target object, like the API it provides, what data it collects etc. With the large number of objects
    that comprise the infrastructure, and the vast majority of them being installed by a human operator,
    it is inevitable that for a great number of devices, the information that comes along will be incomplete
    or inaccurate.
\end{itemize}}

Besides the challenges mentioned above, another one is to provide enough security for the devices that make up
the infrastructure. Having so many small computer that are integrated into the Internet, it is easy to forget
that despite the fact that they may not have a great processing capacity, the numbers in which they come
can offer a great platform from which attackers may act. Any security flaw can leave the IoT vulnerable to
hackers that may use it in destructive ways.

The Internet of Things provides a promising platform on which new insights can be obtained about the world we
live in given that the problem that may arise will be prevented.

\section{Architecture}
\label{Architecture}

This section presents an in-depth look at the architecture used for the thermostat: each of the components,
individually, that make it up and then as an assembly.
Pursuing the first key of the motivation for this approach, the chosen microcontrollers for this
application are in the affordable category, but nonetheless powerful enough to carry out the task.

The first microcontroller used is the ESP8266 wireless module created by Espressif (Figure \ref{fig:esp8266}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\label{fig:esp8266}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=ESP8266.eps,width=0.3\textwidth}}
      \caption[ESP8266]{ESP8266 Wireless Module. Image source: \cite{website:esppicture}.}
\label{fig:esp8266}
\end{figure}

ESP8266 is a highly integrated chip designed for the needs of a new connected world. It offers a complete and
self-contained WiFi networking solution, allowing it to either host the application or to offload all WiFi
networking functions from another application processor \cite{website:espressifdesc}.
The microcontroller is build onto ARM platform, it has 200 kB of ROM, 32 kB of SRAM and 80 kB of DRAM.
Given its relatively great storage capacity and RAM, the ESP8266 is the main processing unit of the thermostat
where the fuzzy logic algorithm will run.
This module also provides, as the name suggests, the connectivity capability. It supports 802.11 b,g and n
standards and has TCP and UDP stack implemented on it.

Since its release, the open-source community has developed a number of programming languages for the ESP8266,
including Lua\cite{website:nodemcu} and JavaScript\cite{website:espruino}. All of these are based on the SDK
that the manufacturer has released and that, eventually, proved to be the preferred choice for this
application because the other languages consume too much memory and lack the robustness that SDK provides.

The SDK comes with a documented API that exposes low-level functions that perform basic tasks like initializing
a WiFi Access Point $(AP)$, making a Http request and creating a server that listens and fetches the requests
that the module receives.

The second microcontroller used is the Atmel Attiny85 (Figure \ref{fig:attiny85}) \cite{website:attiny85}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\label{fig:attiny85}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=attiny85.eps,width=0.3\textwidth}}
      \caption[attiny85]{Atmel Attiny85 Module. Image source: \cite{website:attiny85pic}.}
\label{fig:attiny85}
\end{figure}

This is a small AVR processor with 8 kB of ISP flash memory, 512-Byte SRAM and 6 general purpose I/O lines.
It can be programmed using an Arduino and the Arduino IDE by writing C or C++ code \cite{website:attiny85program}.

The thermostat setup consists of at least two modules: a main module, that lies near the thermal heating unit
and one or more smaller modules that can be spread around the environment. The former records the temperature
and sends it to the main module to be processed.

The main module (Figure \ref{fig:first_module}) is made up of the ESP8266 wireless module, an Attiny85 and a
433 MHz radio receiver and the second module (Figure \ref{fig:second_module}) (that we will call reporter) is
made up of a temperature and humidity sensor (DHT22), an Attiny85 and a 433 MHz radio transmitter. This will
run on battery.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\label{fig:first_module}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=receiver.eps,width=0.5\textwidth}}
      \caption[MainModule]{Main module prototype.}
\label{fig:first_module}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\label{fig:nn}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=transmiter.eps,width=0.3\textwidth}}
      \caption[MainModule]{Second module prototype.}
\label{fig:second_module}
\end{figure}

The way it works is that that the reporter reads the temperature form the sensor and sends it over the 433 MHz
radio. This happens at an established interval such that the battery will last as long as possible
and the data will still be relevant for heating control. The Attiny85 on the main module reads the data
from the 433 HMz radio receiver and stores it until the ESP8266 sends a request over serial communication and asks
for the readings. The data is then processed and a decision is taken (turn the heating on or off) that is
communicated by the ESP8266 to the Attiny85. Besides the above mentioned components, the main module will
also hold a relay that is controlled by the AVR microcontroller in response to the decision that was taken.
The radio communication between the modules is done using the Manchaster encoding library
\cite{website:manchester}.

The user may interact with the thermostat in a couple of ways.
At first start-up, the WiFi module creates an AP (Access Point) and a webserver that listens to the default Http port 80
on IP address 192.168.4.1. A small, lightweight webserver framework was designed in order to facilitate the
processing of requests.
If the page /wifi\_setup is accessed, the user will be presented with a form
where he should enter the SSID of his home wireless access point and the password with which the module
can connect to it. After doing that, in approximately twenty seconds the module will connect to the wireless
router and the AP it created will disappear. The ESP8266 will remember the SSID and password so the next time
it starts-up, the same steps won't be necessary.
After having connected and the AP disappeared, the ESP8266 will make use of its mDNS feature to publish itself
on the intranet he just gained access to. After that, the user, while being connected to his home router, will
be able to access the thermostat by going to http://thermostat.local.

If the thermostat has internet access while connected to the wireless router, it will publish its reading of
temperature, humidity and computed values (rate of heating, rate of cooling) to a remote server.

\section{Thermostat fuzzy engine}

The proposed thermostat uses a Mamdani fuzzy logic engine to reach a conclusion, based on 4 inputs, about
whether or not is the heating supposed to be on.
There are a couple of factors and the relationship amongst them that are taken into consideration when trying to
take this decision. First of all is the difference between the temperature that the user desires and the temperature
that the sensors are currently reading. The larger this difference, the greater the time is in which the heating
should be on. Also, one might set a higher than needed point in order to get to a desired temperature in a shorter
period of time which means that the time the heating should be on is greater. In contrast, multiple, smaller
changes brought to the target temperature, by the user, might mean that the desire is to achieve a more accurate
temperature control.

The second factor is the relation between the temperature and the relative humidity (Figure \ref{fig:humidex}).
The higher the relative humidity is, the greater the felt temperature will be. This is called the Humidex and
it is a measure of how hot a person feels. It is an equivalent scale intended for the general public to
express the combined effects of warm temperatures and humidity. It provides a number that describes how hot
people feel \cite{website:humidex}. A rule of thumb is presented in Table \ref{table:humidex_thumb} and a
graphical representation of the correlation between temperature and relative humidity is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:humidex}. Taking this into consideration, rules are constructed in such a way that heating control is
\say{aware} that comfort level in high humidity is low.

\begin{center}
    \begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
        \hline
        Humidex range & Degree of comfort  \\ \hline
        20 - 29 & comfortable \\ \hline
        30 - 39 & some discomfort \\ \hline
        40 - 45 & great discomfort; avoid exertion \\ \hline
        above 45 & dangerous; heat stroke possible \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[Humidex rule of thumb]{Humidex rule of thumb. Source \cite{website:humidex}.}
    \label{table:humidex_thumb}
    \end{table}
\end{center}

Another factor taken into consideration is the rate at which the sensed environment heats up or cools down. This
information helps take pre-emptive measures or avoid heating a room in which the temperature is steadily rising.

\subsubsection{Fuzzy engine}
\label{Thermostat fuzzy engine}

Having described the factors that are taken into consideration, these are the inputs that the fuzzy engine takes:\par
\begin{itemize}
\item Input 1: temperature error; the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature of the room
\item Input 2: humidity; the relative humidity from the environment
\item Input 3: rate of heating; temperature trend in a given time frame; more on this below
\item Input 4: rate of cooling; similar to rate of heating
\item Output: heating status; this is an output fuzzy set and represents the decision at which the engine has arrived
based on all the inputs described above
\end{itemize}

The inputs temperature and humidity are read from the sensors but rate of cooling and heating have to be
calculated in order to get the trend of the temperature. This was done by storing and analyzing data from
a certain time interval in the past. Several approaches were considered for getting a useful value from the
data points:
\begin{itemize}

\item the difference between the last datapoint ($t_{m}$) and first data point ($t_{1}$) from the dataset
\begin{align}
Rate of cooling = t_{m} - t_{1}
\end{align}

\item computing the average temperature difference at every measurement
\begin{align}
Rate of cooling = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(t_{i + 1} - t_{i})}{(m - 1)}
\end{align}

\item using least squares regression line method to approximate a function that best describes the dataset
and use that function's slope as input for the engine
\begin{align}
Rate of cooling = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_{i} - \overline{X})(y_{i} - \overline{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_{i} - \overline{X})^2}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\overline{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{i}}{m}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\overline{Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{i}}{m}
\end{align}

\end{itemize}

Experiments (Figure \ref{fig:experiments}) showed that the last method, least squares, proved to be the most
steady and relevant with the fluctuations of temperature.
Even with extreme differences of more than 20 degrees, that would normally represent a glitch or a temporary
situation, the values drop back to the actual representation of data in about three minutes. This can be
improved by increasing the hysteresis of the system, i.e. increase the temperature sample time frame such
that sporadic records have a smaller impact on the results.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\label{fig:nn}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=experiments.eps,width=0.5\textwidth}}
      \caption[MainModule]{Values of slope with regard to temperature change.}
\label{fig:experiments}
\end{figure}

All the linguistic variables described above have associated with them three linguistic values: '\say{low},
\say{moderate} and \say{high}. The engine uses a combination of triangular and trapezium membership functions
(Figure \ref{fig:humidity_mf}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\label{fig:nn}
\centerline{\psfig{figure=humidity_mf_labeled.eps,width=0.5\textwidth}}
      \caption[MainModule]{Humidity membership functions.}
\label{fig:humidity_mf}
\end{figure}

\qquad The fuzzy engine contains a set of fifty six rules that were defined using an expert's knowledge of
temperature control. This section presents o few of them.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \say{if temp\_err is low and humidity is moderate and rate\_of\_heating is high then heat\_status is
     off} \par
    This is a general case where the heating should be off because the temperature error is low, meaning that
    the temperature that the environment exhibits is close to the temperature the user has set. Also, because
    the humidity is moderate, the conditions are such that the humidex \ref{fig:humidex} would be in a
    comfortable range. The only parameter that is high is the rate of heating. This means that the temperature
    is rising at a fast rate. If all of these tests are passed, the heating should be off.

    \item \say{if temp\_err is moderate and humidity is low and rate\_of\_heating is moderate heat\_status is
    on} \par
    This rule states that, although the temperature error is moderate and the rate of heating is moderate,
    which means that the temperature is slowly rising to the user's desired point, the heating status
    should be on due to the fact that the humidity is low which leads to a low humidex. A low humidex
    expresses the fact that the comfort level is low and that the temperature or the humidity should rise.

    \item \say{if temp\_err is low and humidity is low and rate\_of\_cooling is high then heat\_status is on}
    \par
    This situation expresses the case when although the temperature error is low, the humidity is also low
    and the rate at which the environment cools down is high. This situation requires the heating to be on
    in order to remain at a constant temperature.

    \item \say{if temp\_err is high and humidity is high and rate\_of\_heating is high then heat\_status is
    on} \par
    It may happen that despite the fact that the humidex is high and the rate of heating is also high, the
    temperature error is high as well, making it necessary to turn the heating on to compensate.

The fuzzy engine is triggered at an established interval of time by a timer that runs on the ESP8266, usually
a minute, and the decision is sent over serial communication to the on-board Attiny85 which controls the relay.

\section{Results and discussions}
\label{Results and discussions}

Experiments have shown that the chosen hardware and software setup is well fit to accomplish the task of
running a fuzzy engine and handle the communication with the user and with itself.
The main concern that was present while developing was if the 32 kB memory of the ESP8266 will be enough to run
the fuzzy engine and the first encountered challenge was the proper memory management and avoidance of memory leaks.
While testing it was found that the \say{infrastructure} code, which is responsible for the interaction with
the user, is consuming about 4 kB of SRAM.
The fuzzy engine is initialized at system start-up and it won't be freed from memory since it consumes about 10 kB of code. When running, the memory overhead is of approximately 3 kB.

Testing was done to see how the ESP8266 behaves in time. While testing the responsiveness, a
loss of 14\% of the packets sent was recorded. The module behaves well except the times when a CPU intensive activity is going on like running the fuzzy engine or publishing the data on the remote server.

In the event of a system crash, the ESP8266 recovers immediately and resumes normal operation, including connection
to wireless router and mDNS publishing.

The fuzzy engine was tested and the resulting data was aggregated in Figure \ref{fig:result1} and
\ref{fig:result2}. Figure \ref{fig:result1} shows the graph with the Y axis starting from 100 and decreasing
while Figure \ref{fig:result2} show the graph with the Y axis starting from 0 and increasing.
For both of the figures, we have the X axis that represents the temperature error, the Y axis that represents
the humidity and the Z axis which represents the temperature trend that is described by the slope of the
line defined by a given number of past recorded temperature points. The Z axis encompasses the
rate\_of\_cooling (for negative values) and rate\_of\_heating (for positive values) linguistic variables.

Analyzing Figure \ref{fig:result1} we can see that going from temperature error 0 to 2.2
the state of the heating only gets set to ON starting from 1.8 but only for steady temperature trend. This is
because the humidity is at 90 percent which lowers the comfort level. A possible improvement that can be
observed is that comfort changes according to both humidity and temperature (Figure \ref{fig:humidex}) and
that another parameter could be added to the fuzzy engine that would comply to the data in Figure
\ref{fig:humidex}.

      \caption[Humidity and temperature correlation]{Humidity and temperature correlation.}
\label{fig:humidex}
\end{figure}

Looking at Figure \ref{fig:result1} we can see that the graph has an overall uniform distribution with the
moderate to high temperature error and low to moderate humidity resulting in turning the heat on while
the low to moderate temperature error and moderate to high humidity resulting in turning the head off.
The only exception is when the temperature trend (slope) is around 0. In this case, only the temperature and
the humidity are the factors that are taken into consideration.

\centerline{\psfig{figure=results1.eps,width=0.5\textwidth}}
      \caption[Aggregated results (first figure).]{Aggregated results (first figure).}
\label{fig:result1}
\end{figure}

A problem that can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:result2} is the fact that for temperature trend of 0,
temperature error 0 and humidity 0, the decision is to turn the heat on. Although the humidity is 0, which
would result in an uncomfortable environment, the current temperature is identical with the one the user has
set and it is also steady, so the correct decision would be to turn the heating off. This has yet to be
improved.

      \caption[Aggregated results (second figure).]{Aggregated results (second figure).}
\label{fig:result2}
\end{figure}

With the help of results from further experiments, the rules of the fuzzy engine will be tweaked and possibly
more input parameters will be added such that the decisions will be as informed as possible.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conclusion}

As seen from the experiments, the proposed solution is a promising one, offering enough computational power
to run a fairly complex algorithm, sufficiently advanced hardware to accomplish the needs for a IoT enabled
thermostat and cheap enough to be in a price range that can surpass the current, main-stream thermostats.
Fuzzy logic seems to be an appropriate control method, performing as expected although improvements are in
order.
